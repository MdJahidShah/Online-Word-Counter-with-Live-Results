# Live Word Counter Tool

The **Live Word Counter Tool** is a simple yet efficient web-based tool that allows users to count words, characters, and lines in real time. Built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and styled with **Bootstrap**, this tool updates dynamically as the user types.

## Features

- **User-friendly interface** with a clean Bootstrap design.
- **Fully responsive** for different screen sizes.
- **No external dependencies** apart from Bootstrap CDN.

## Technologies Used
